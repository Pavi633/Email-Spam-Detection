This project is a web-based spam detection application built using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework. The primary aim of the application is to classify email or message content as "Spam" or "Ham" (not spam), helping users effectively filter unwanted messages. By leveraging a pre-trained machine learning model, the application analyzes user input and provides real-time feedback on the classification of the text, enhancing the user's ability to manage their communications.

At the heart of the application is a machine learning model trained on a dataset of labeled emails, which enables it to identify patterns and features indicative of spam content. To preprocess the user input, the application utilizes a Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorizer, transforming the text into numerical feature vectors that can be easily processed by the model. This ensures that the model receives data in a consistent format, facilitating accurate predictions.

The user interface is designed using HTML and Jinja2 templates, creating an intuitive experience for users. Upon accessing the home route, users can input their email or message text into a simple form. After submission, the application converts the input into feature vectors, invokes the model for prediction, and displays the result back to the user, indicating whether the message is classified as "Spam" or "Ham." This seamless integration of machine learning and user interaction not only demonstrates the practical applications of natural language processing but also highlights the importance of user-friendly design in technology solutions.
